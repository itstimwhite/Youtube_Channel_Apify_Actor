  "channelDescription": "Twice a year we invest a small amount of money ($500k) in a large number of startups.\n\nWe work intensively with the companies for three months, to get them into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. Each cycle culminates in Demo Day, when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience.\n\nBut YC doesnâ€™t end on Demo Day. We and the YC alumni network continue to help founders for the life of their company, and beyond.\n\nhttps://YCombinator.com",
